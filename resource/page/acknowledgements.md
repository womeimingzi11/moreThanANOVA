# Acknowledgements

This app is powered by `Shiny` package.

The theme is `yeti` from `shinythemes` package.

Internationalization was implemented by `shiny.i18n` package.

The table views are powered by `DT` package.

Data manipulation and figure plot works are powered by `tidyverse` Bundles.

Permutation tests are performed by `coin` pacakge.

`broom` pacakge is used to extract the results of anova, wilcox.test and kruskal.test.

The sig-levels of post-hoc test in the table are calculated by `rcompanion` and extracted by `multcompView`.

Post-hoc test figures are generated by `ggstatsplot` and combined by `cowplot`.
